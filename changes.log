Version 2.9.0
    + Added an option to "Connect through SSL/TLS", enabled by default, due to recently-added HTTPS support on Cantr's server.
        + There are plans to require the use of SSL/TLS in the future, after which CantrSpy will likely not work without this.
        + It is possible (but unlikely) that Cantr will cease to support SSL/TLS, in which case CantrSpy will only work when this is disabled.
    + Changed to a new publication certificate, since the previous certificate expired.
        + Users of previous versions must manually uninstall the old version, then install the new version.
        + Settings and saved login details from the old version will not be present in the new version.
        + Certain previous versions (without a digitally signed timestamp) will no longer work, while others may work.

    - Fixed an error which could occur when repeatedly logging in and out while the icon is flashing.

Version 2.8.1
    + Corrected some errors in the Spanish translation.

Version 2.8.0
    + Single-clicking the tray icon on Windows and Linux machines now has two functions:
        + when the icon is flashing, it will only stop the icon from flashing;
        + otherwise, it will perform the usual task of forcing an immediate update.
    + Added an option to change the user interface language.
        + By default, the operating system's locale will be used to determine the language.
        + Spanish and English are currently available as selectable languages.
        + Added Spanish strings to the application descriptor which can be used by the installer in Spanish locales.
    + Implemented the capability for the icon to flash either indefinitely or for a limited period of time in response to a character newly having new events.
        + The parameters for this behaviour can be set from the settings window.
        + The flashing can be stopped using the icons's context menu, or by clicking the icon as detailed above.
        + The flashing will also stop if the character in question is found to no longer have new events, having the effect that the icon will continue to flash until the new events are viewed (or the maximum time period is exceeded, if one is set).
    + Rearranged some context menu items.
    + Made changes concerning the Tick Timings window:
        + There is now an option in the settings window to open the ticks window when the application starts.
        + The ticks window is now resizable (size and position will also be remembered)
        + The ticks window can now be opened from the settings window.
        + Settings concerning the ticks window have their own group in the settings window.
    + It can now be detected when the game is locked. When this is the case, an appropriate message will be displayed.
    - Various minor code adjustments.

    + Implemented a settings window, openable from the login window and from the icon menu.
    + Changed the appearance of the login window for consistency and moved the "Run on startup" option from the login window to the settings window.

    + Added an option to disable automatic update checking, which is accessible from the settings dialog.
    + Added an option to manually check for updates, accessible from the same location as the checkbox.
    + Added the option to select an additional style of icon, which does not use transparency, for compatibility with Linux operating systems where the transparent icon was not rendered correctly.
    - Patched a number of memory leaks in the AIR runtime, significantly improving memory consumption stability, by:
        - implementing an explicit periodic garbage collection process;
        - wherever possible, rewriting code to reuse already initialised objects instead of creating new ones; and
        - keeping already loaded icon files in memory instead of discarding them when they are unused.
    - Implemented a configurationManager class to allow preferences and other persistent values to be kept by the application.
    - Made changes to the windowManager class to allow implementation of Ticks window.
    - Removed the 128×128 icon files; added 24×24 icons.
    - Various minor code changes.

    + Added capability to "update now" which causes the application to immediately send an update request to the server.
        + Added application icon right-click menu entry for this function.
        + This can also be triggered by single-clicking the system tray icon (Windows/Linux only).
        - The icon will change to a blank circle to indicate that the request is in progress.
        - The user cannot initiate a new request if one is already in progress.
        - Updates will still occur automatically, however the timer is reset after a user-initiated update.
    + A player page open request can now be initiated by double-clicking the system tray icon (Windows/Linux only). This will perform exactly the same action as selecting the corresponding application icon menu item.
    - Made some minor structural and interface related changes.

Version 2.5.2
    + Made verbose error messages always display, even if they exceed the tooltip limit.
    + Added descriptive error message for generic connection failure.

Version 2.5.1
    + Added checkbox on login window enabling user credentials to be saved.
        + When the application is started with details saved, no login window will be displayed - the application will automatically begin logging in.

        + Details are saved when a login attempt is made with "remember details" checked.
    - Fixed some minor errors.

Version 2.5.0
    + Added checkbox on login window which enables application to be set to run on startup (when that specific user logs in, technically).

    + The version number is displayed in the bottom-left corner of the login window.

Version 2.4.7
    + Fixed an error which occured in Windows XP when the desktop is composed of multiple screens, in which the application window is centered on the top-left corner of the main screen. The window is now always created in the centre of the primary screen. Note: compatibility has not been tested yet on other operating systems.
    - changes.log is now included with the installation package (and can be found on the root of the installation directory).

Version 2.4.5
    + Added icons to show the number of active characters from 1 to 15
    - Changed the behaviour of the iconManager: a set of icons is loaded into memory as a result of being set as the current icons, and icons are unloaded when they are no longer directly in use
    + Prevented any tray icon from being created during a login sequence involving an open login window
    - Changed update request method to POST for greater security
    - Fixed a memory leak in which references were kept to instances of the login window after they were closed

    - Changed login.htm to resize its self dynamically based on its content
    + Added a status field to the login window
    - Made some miscellaneous code changes
    + Changed the server response "ERROR Hacking attempt" to trigger an invalid login error (due to the fact that a player ID containing non-digit characters triggered such an error).
    + Caused the login window to stay open during a login attempt, closing when a network response is recieved that does not indicate incorrect details. If the user details are incorrect, this is reported to the user who has the opportunity to re-enter them.

Version 2.3.0
    + Added command to open the user's player page in the native browser
    - Created global settings object to hold constant values
        - Moved the remote server definition to settings
